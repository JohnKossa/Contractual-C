# Contractual-C
## What is it?
Contractual C takes the very best of the C language and combines it with the very best of legalese.

## Is it ready yet?
No, sadly this exists as a dream for now. If I get a fair amount of time, this may see the light of day. If not, it'll end up like my other projects.

## What are the next steps?
1. Write the tokens as Haskell constructs and build a parser.

2. Have the Haskell program accept strings and execute them as a parsed program.

3. ???

4. Profit

## Pieces
### Try Catch
Given that -> try

Nonwithstanding the afforementioned -> catch

### Variable declarations
The integer party of the first part hereafter known as count -> int count; (used for the first int declared in a funciton)

The integer party of the second part herafter known as amount -> int amount; (used for the second int declared in a function)

The integer party of the third part -> (the third int declared in a function, note: variable names are not required. Unnamed variables like this are referred to as "the integer party of the third part")

### Function declaration and invoking
Section 4 -> function 4 (all functions must be given numerical or alphabetic definitions)

Pursuant to Section 4 -> invokes function 4

Pursuant to Section 4 concerning the parties of the third part and amount -> invokes function 4 passing the third int and amount

This section grants the value-> return

### Conditionals
In the case of -> if

being -> equality check

surpassing -> (greater than)

### Operators
shall be ->  (assignment)

and the portion -> (addition)

less the portion -> (subtraction)

distributed evenly among -> (division)

apportioned evenly to each of -> (multiplication)

### IO
Let the record show -> print

## Examples
### Fibonacci Sequence
Section 1 concerning the integer party the first part:

In the case of the party of the first part being 0, this section grants the value 0.

In the case of the party of the first part being 1, this section grants the value 1.

In the case of the party of the first part surpassing 1, this section grants the value pursuant to Section 1 concerning the party of the first part less the portion 1 and the portion pursuant to Section 1 concerning the party of the first part less the portion 2.
