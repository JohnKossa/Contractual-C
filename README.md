# Contractual-C
## What is it?
Contractual C takes the very best of the C language and combines it with the very best of legalese.

## Is it ready yet?
No, sadly this exists as a dream for now. If I get a fair amount of time, this may see the light of day. If not, it'll end up like my other projects.

## Examples
### Try Catch
Given that -> try

Nonwithstanding the afforementioned -> catch

### Variable declarations
The integer party of the first part hereafter known as count -> int count; (used for the first int declared in a funciton)

The integer party of the second part herafter known as amount -> int amount; (used for the second int declared in a function)

The integer party of the third part -> (the third int declared in a function, note: variable names are not required. Unnamed variables like this are referred to as "the integer party of the third part")

### Function declaration and invoking
Section 4 -> function 4 (all functions must be given numerical or alphabetic definitions)

Pursuant to Section 4 -> invokes function 4

Pursuant to Section 4 concerning the parties of the third part and amount -> invokes function 4 passing the third int and amount
